The error messages indicate that the variable substitution is incorrect. The correct syntax for variable substitution in bash is `${VARIABLE}`. You don't need an extra `$` inside the braces.

In your script, you have:

```bash
/home/${USER}/.ssh/${$SSH_KEY}
```

The correct syntax should be:

```bash
/home/${USER}/.ssh/${SSH_KEY}
```

Similarly, correct all occurrences of this pattern in your script. After making these changes, your script should execute without that specific error.
